## Introduction

This project is a CLI-based implementation of the classic Tetris game, developed using Rust and the `ratatui.rs` library. `ratatui.rs` is a library for building rich terminal user interfaces. The main objective of this project is for me to learn more about how to write code in Rust programming, as this is my first ever Rust-only repository

## Features (WORK IN PROGRESS)

- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Colorful and responsive terminal UI
- High score tracking
